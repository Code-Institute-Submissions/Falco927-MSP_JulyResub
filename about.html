        <h2 class="center">Festive Brand</h2> 
        <p class="centered" >We started our Festive space odyssey from our apartment in 2012, and after two years we had saved some money to open our first Gift Basket Premise.
          For the first 3 years we offered lots of alternatives to hampers, the next five years we aimed to make them better, and now you arrive at our website,which we hope will grow in strength for the next 7 years.  
          The fusion of gift basket design, hamper quality and great customer service has converged to enable us to offer a truly huge range of amazing Gifts divided by type, recipient and occasion.

          Festive Space is a Gift Basket Company for all of the UK & Ireland - not just a local business - which means that you buy direct, and we ship to recipients within 24 hrs. 
          The first six months of the year, we offer Gifts & Baskets for Valentines Day, Easter, Mothers Day and Fathers Day. 
          We also create innovative and imaginative gifts for special occasions,  you might want to send a gift basket to say Thank-You, Happy Birthday, Congratulations and 
          for Celebration gifting events such as the birth of a New Baby or a special Anniversary.

          Obviously our busiest time of the year is Christmas, when we work round the clock seven days a week, to ensure we get every order delivered to our customers on time for Xmas.
